# Abilities and Limitations

Nanobots are amazing, but they don't defy the laws of physics.



This is a quick reference just so you can have all of their abilities and limitations in one place.

If you want to know how their abilities and limitations can be used in regards to specific types of magic, you should reference those particular sections of this book.



## Abilities

- **Artificially intelligent**
  - Nanobots have their own onboard intelligence, and can be considered sentient.
  - This basically reduces nanomagic to simply communicating with a swarm of AI.
- **Wireless communication**
  - Nanobots can wirelessly communicate with any standard neural lace.
  - Due to security standards, your nanobots only have permission to communicate with your own neural lace by default, but may obtain permission from other neural lace users.
- **Kinesis**
  - Nanobots can apply  up to **1 PSI** of pressure in up to a **1000 nm^2^** area.
  - A fully charged nanobot can maintain a kinetic force of 1 PSI spread out over 1000 nm^2^ for about **1.5 min**.
- **Electrical Charge**
  - Nanobots can apply a voltage up to **12 V**
  - Nanobots can apply a current up to **10 A**
  - A fully charged nanobot can maintain 12 V @ 10 A for about **1.5 min**.
- **Heat**
  - Nanobots can radiate heat energy up to **1000 C**
  - A fully charged nanobot can maintain a temperature of 1000 C for about **1.5 min.**
